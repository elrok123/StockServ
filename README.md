StockServ application for Scott Logic and Heriot-Watt university

At present this branch is being used for developing client functionality.

There will be one controller, Client, which will have actions add, remove and edit, and will be
responsible for dealing with requests to manage clients

There will be one model, ClientData, which will deal with querying the table of client details. In order to
add clients to an FA it may also be necessary to include an FA model, which will be added later

There will be at most three views, I think

Oh and this is also a commit test. Sorry if I cock it up guys, I tend to break things. Oops.
